// Story #5002 — the new-method ceiling stops capping untestable CLI wiring.
//
// `crap = c²·(1 − cov)³ + c` collapses to `c² + c` at zero coverage, so the
// default ceiling of 30 caps a brand-new method in an untested file at c ≈ 5.
// For argv parsing, `spawn` wiring and a CLI's top-level `main()` — code that
// is untestable by construction — that is a fragmentation tax, not a quality
// signal. A new method in a file whose every method scored 0% is therefore
// judged on its complexity term alone; every other file is unchanged.
