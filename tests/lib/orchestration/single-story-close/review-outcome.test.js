/**

 * The module shipped with no tests of its own: its two exports were reachable
 * only through the close phase that calls them, so the degraded-review wording
 * could assert whatever it liked without a single assertion disagreeing. That
 * is how the false `npm run lint` coverage claim survived — the fix is only
 * durable with the wording under test.
