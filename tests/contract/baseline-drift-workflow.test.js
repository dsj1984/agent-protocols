/**
 * The nightly full-scope baseline re-score.
 *
 * Every other baseline gate in this repository is diff-scoped: it reads the
 * committed rows for the files a change touched. `baseline-drift.yml` is the
 * only thing that re-scores the tree, so drift in an untouched file is
 * invisible without it. That makes the workflow load-bearing in a way a
 * scheduled job usually is not — nobody watches a nightly, so if it silently
 * stops measuring, the gap it was built to close reopens unnoticed.
 *
 * These pin the three properties that failure mode turns on:
 *
 *   1. the job actually invokes the drift CLI;
 *   2. it passes `--require-scored`, without which a kind the detector cannot
 *      score returns `{ ok: true, skipped }` and the run goes green having
 *      measured nothing (the exact fail-open this Story closed);
 *   3. it stays off the per-PR path, so the duplication Story #5004 removed
 *      is not quietly reintroduced under a new name.
