/**
 * Contract tests binding the `audit-adrs` lens to the decisions-log contract
 * it audits against.
 *
 * The lens is prose: it is the prompt an auditor runs on, so a claim it makes
 * about ADR structure is only as good as its agreement with the skill that
 * defines that structure. Nothing mechanical couples the two files — the lens
 * could name five canonical sections while the skill names seven, and both
 * would keep "passing" while auditors graded real ADRs against a vocabulary
 * the project never adopted.
 *
 * So these pin the couplings that must not drift independently:
 *
 *  1. The canonical ADR section list and both layout names are stated by the
 *     skill and honoured by the lens (AC-6).
 *  2. The lens keeps the shared-machinery contract every lens carries — one
 *     substitution fence, the core reference, its own report path (AC-1).
 *  3. The lens's five dimensions are its finding vocabulary, and the
 *     Accepted-only scoping of the drift claim-check survives (AC-3).
