# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## ADR 001: Autonomous Protocol Refinement Loop

**Status:** Reverted (Moved to manual process)  
**Date:** 2026-04-09  
**Epic:** #74

### Context
Frequent friction during agent execution (e.g., tool misuse, prompt ambiguity) requires manual protocol updates. This creates a bottleneck and prevents the system from scaling its efficiency.

### Decision
We will implement an autonomous, closed-loop system that:
1.  Ingests friction logs from completed tasks.
2.  Uses an LLM-based agent to identify patterns and propose protocol updates.
3.  Automatically creates PRs for these updates.
4.  Tracks the performance impact post-merge.

### Consequences
*   **Positive:** Reduced manual maintenance, faster protocol maturation, data-driven improvement.
*   **Negative:** Increased GitHub API usage, potential for low-quality automated PRs if prompts are weak.
*   **Mitigation:** Human-in-the-loop (HITL) requirement for merging refinement PRs.

## ADR 002: Real-time Sprint Health Monitoring

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-04-09  
**Epic:** #74

### Context
Operators lack visibility into "stalled" sprints or widespread tool failures during parallel task execution.

### Decision
Implement a single-issue "Sprint Health" dashboard in GitHub that is updated via `health-monitor.js` after every major task state transition.

### Consequences
*   **Positive:** Immediate visibility into systemic failures.
*   **Negative:** High edit frequency on a single issue might trigger GitHub rate limits.
*   **Mitigation:** Debounced updates and batching metrics.

## ADR 003: Worktree-per-Story Isolation for Parallel Sprint Execution

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-04-15
**Epic:** #229
**Version shipped:** 5.7.0

### Context

Parallel sprint execution prior to v5.7.0 shared one working tree across all
story agents. On 2026-04-14, five concurrent agents under `epic/267` raced on
branch checkouts and swept a WIP file from one story into another story's
commit. v5.5.1 shipped three symptomatic fixes (tri-state Epic branch
bootstrap, pre-commit `assert-branch.js`, focus-area wave serialization). These
prevented the specific failure modes observed but did not address the root
cause: multiple agents mutating one working tree at the same time.

### Decision

Each dispatched story runs in its own `git worktree` at
`.worktrees/story-<id>/`. A single `WorktreeManager` owns the worktree
lifecycle (`ensure` / `reap` / `list` / `isSafeToRemove` / `gc`). The
dispatcher constructs a manager when
`orchestration.worktreeIsolation.enabled` is `true` and threads the worktree
path as `cwd` through the execution adapter. Single-tree mode remains a
first-class fallback via `enabled: false`.

Supporting decisions:

- **No `git worktree --force` from framework code.** Dirty tree ⇒ refuse to
  delete; operator may run `--force` manually as an escape hatch.
- **`core.longpaths=true`** set per worktree on win32; a pre-flight
  path-length warning is posted on the Epic issue when the estimated deepest
  path exceeds the configured threshold.
- **`gitFetchWithRetry`** retries only on known packed-refs lock-contention
  signatures; unrelated fetch failures surface immediately. No global mutex
  — that would erase the parallelism the model is designed to enable.
- **`node_modules` strategy is explicit**: `per-worktree` (default, correct
  everywhere), `symlink` (requires `primeFromPath`; Windows opt-in via
  `allowSymlinkOnWindows`), `pnpm-store` (agent runs `pnpm install` against
  the shared store).

### Consequences

*   **Positive:**
    *   Main-checkout reflog stays quiet during parallel sprints; agent
        activity is confined to per-worktree reflogs.
    *   Defense-in-depth preserved: `assert-branch.js` and focus-area
        serialization remain in place for the fallback mode and as second-
        line guards in worktree mode.
    *   Fallback mode works with existing v5.5.1 tests unchanged.
*   **Negative:**
    *   Increased disk usage for `per-worktree` install strategy; `symlink`
        and `pnpm-store` mitigate at the cost of platform fragility.
    *   Windows long-path handling requires explicit operator attention
        when the worktree root nests deeply.
    *   Concurrent `git fetch` can collide on `.git/packed-refs.lock`;
        handled by bounded retry rather than a global lock.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   `worktree-lifecycle.md` documents the model, Windows notes, and
        escape hatches.
    *   Real-git integration test (`tests/integration/parallel-sprint.test.js`)
        asserts AC6 (no WIP cross-contamination across five concurrent
        stories) and AC7 (main-checkout reflog quiet) on every run.

## ADR 004: Gherkin Standards as Sole SSOT for BDD Tags & Forbidden Patterns

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-04-19
**Epic:** #269

### Context

Epic #269 introduces a BDD authoring framework: one rule
(`.agents/rules/gherkin-standards.md`), two skills
(`skills/stack/qa/gherkin-authoring`, `skills/stack/qa/playwright-bdd`), one
workflow (`/run-bdd-suite`), and a pyramid-aware rewrite of
`testing-standards.md`. Without a single source of truth for the tag taxonomy
and forbidden patterns, the two skills and every consuming project would
inevitably drift into parallel vocabularies — exactly the failure mode that
made Cucumber suites unmaintainable in earlier industry cycles.

### Decision

`.agents/rules/gherkin-standards.md` is the **sole** SSOT for:

- the canonical tag taxonomy (`@smoke`, `@risk-high`, `@platform-*`,
  `@domain-*`, `@flaky`);
- the forbidden-pattern list (SQL/ORM calls, status codes, DOM selectors, raw
  URLs, payloads, framework names, explicit waits);
- Scenario Outline conventions, selector discipline, and the step-reuse
  protocol.

Skills and workflows MUST reference the rule rather than restate it. Additions
to the taxonomy require a PR that updates the rule before use. The
`testing-standards.md` pyramid rule is the companion SSOT for tier-placement of
assertions; acceptance-tier scenarios defer shape-of-data concerns to contract
tests rather than encoding them in `.feature` files.

### Consequences

*   **Positive:**
    *   One place to look for the tag grammar; reviewers can mechanically
        reject unknown tags.
    *   `gherkin-authoring` and `playwright-bdd` stay focused on *how* and
        *when* without redefining *what*.
    *   The audit from Task #294 becomes a repeatable pattern — grep the
        skills for redefinition, point at the rule.
*   **Negative:**
    *   Rule-level changes are higher friction than editing a skill; adding a
        new domain tag requires a PR to the rule.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   `@domain-<slug>` is extensible by design — consumers pick their own
        slug without touching the rule. Only the top-level tag *categories*
        are closed.

## ADR: Decompose oversized orchestration modules via facade pattern

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-04-20
**Epic:** #297

### Context

Three orchestration-SDK modules grew past the point where a single file
usefully described a single responsibility: `lib/worktree-manager.js`
(1,234 LOC), `lib/orchestration/dispatch-engine.js` (874 LOC), and
`lib/presentation/manifest-renderer.js` (600 LOC). The 5.12.3 clean-code
audit flagged them as the top structural-complexity outliers in the
repository. The DRY portion of the audit had already been addressed via
new shared utilities (`lib/risk-gate.js`, `lib/label-constants.js`,
`lib/path-security.js`, `lib/error-formatting.js`,
`lib/issue-link-parser.js`). What remained was purely a structural
decomposition.

### Decision

Split each target file into cohesive submodules, then reduce the original
file to a **thin facade** that re-exports the same public symbols.

- `lib/worktree-manager.js` → 223-LOC facade composing `lib/worktree/`
  submodules (`lifecycle-manager`, `node-modules-strategy`,
  `bootstrapper`, `inspector`).
- `lib/orchestration/dispatch-engine.js` → 196-LOC coordinator composing
  `wave-dispatcher`, `risk-gate-handler`, `health-check-service`,
  `epic-lifecycle-detector`, `dispatch-pipeline`, and `dispatch-logger`.
- `lib/presentation/manifest-renderer.js` → 175-LOC facade composing
  `manifest-formatter` (pure) and `manifest-persistence` (fs I/O).

The facade files are the **only** part of the stable public surface;
submodule paths are internal implementation detail.

### Consequences

*   **Positive:**
    *   No caller needs to change — `dispatcher.js`,
        `mcp-orchestration.js`, `sprint-story-{init,close}.js`, and every
        test file continue to import from the existing paths.
    *   Each submodule owns one responsibility and is individually
        unit-testable; 65 new per-submodule tests landed alongside the
        refactor (13 manifest + 35 worktree + 17 orchestration).
    *   Future behaviour changes touch the submodule that owns the
        concern, not a 1,000-LOC grab-bag.
*   **Negative:**
    *   The facade carries a handful of backwards-compat `_*` delegate
        methods on `WorktreeManager` so the existing 46-test
        `worktree-manager.test.js` keeps passing without edits. They are
        technical debt to be retired once those tests migrate to
        per-submodule imports.
    *   One new lazy-VerboseLogger implementation (`dispatch-logger.js`)
        duplicates the pattern used elsewhere in the codebase.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Retro action items track both the delegate retirement and the
        lazy-logger consolidation.
    *   Downstream consumers are explicitly told (in `architecture.md`
        and this ADR) that only the facade paths are stable — submodule
        paths may be renamed without a major version bump.
