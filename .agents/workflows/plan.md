## Inputs

Single planning path — there is no
Epic/Story router, no scope-triage `epic|story` verdict:

| Invocation | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `/plan --seed "<text>"` / `--seed-file <path>` | Ideation from chat text or on-disk notes: interrogate → author **one Story by default** → persist. |
| `/plan --tickets 123[,456…]` | Fetch issue(s), analyze into proper Stories (prefer N=1 rewrite). |
| `/plan --amends #<id>` | Amend a shipped Story from a **delta envelope** (prior body + acceptance + delivered file map), not a from-scratch re-interrogation. |

`--body` is **not** a `/plan` entry; persist always goes through `plan-persist.js`.

## Flags

Workflow-level flags only — the ones that change what **you** do:

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--seed "<text>"` / `--seed-file <path>` | Seed text / pre-authored notes path. |
| `--tickets <ids>` | Issue ids to analyze; closed as superseded at persist. |
| `--amends #<id>` | Prior Story to amend; emits a delta envelope, not a full re-interrogation. |
| `--force-review` | STOP at gate #2 for operator review — the only review gate. |
| `--yes` | Non-interactive: auto-proceed gate #1 and gate #2 HITL waits. |
| `--dry-run` | Author + validate without GitHub writes; run as a pre-pass. |

Every other flag is a passthrough to a CLI that documents itself — run the
command with `--help` rather than looking for a copy of its surface here.

## Default-single split policy

Author **one Story** unless the pieces have **near-zero overlap** (genuinely
independent capabilities) or sit across an **architectural seam** (different
deployables, migration vs consumer). Coupled work stays one Story —
`## Slicing` intra-session checkpoints, not sibling tickets; when N>1 every
acceptance criterion belongs to exactly one Story
(`assertAcceptancePartition` refuses coupled splits). **N=1 is the lean
path:** one authoring prompt, folded `## Spec`, no Epic-scale ceremony.

## Procedure

### 1. Interrogate

```bash
node .agents/scripts/plan-context.js --seed "<seed>" \
  --out temp/plan-<slug>/plan-context.json
# or: --seed-file <path>  |  --tickets 123,456  |  --amends #<id>
```

**Always pass `--out`.** Persist auto-discovers that envelope from `--plan-dir`
and derives source-ticket ids from its `sourceTickets[]`; the CLI also
writes **`stories.template.json`** — the authoring skeleton step 2 starts from.

The envelope carries docs context, the codebase snapshot, the story-author
prompt, `sourceTickets[]`, `duplicates[]` (open **Stories**, never Epics), and
advisory `complexitySignals` (**no routing authority**). A trivial scope
earns `--route-downgrade-reason "<why>"` at persist — shape-validated, failing
closed to `full`
([detail](helpers/plan-reference.md)).
Under `--yes`, do not ask free-form operator questions — unresolved unknowns
land in Key Assumptions.

**Gate #1** — STOP to confirm the sharpened plan intent and any
duplicate-candidate review. Under `--yes`, auto-proceed. When
`complexitySignals.deliverLightSuggestion.suggested` is `true`, surface an
**advisory** `/deliver-light` suggestion — the operator decides; under `--yes`
it is recorded and planning proceeds, **never an automatic reroute**.

### 2. Author

**One-shot authoring.** Start from `stories.template.json`;
author `stories.json` in one pass. Entries are pre-resolved; keep
tiers/assumptions valid. `body` is a markdown string **or** a structured
object; persist parses either, serializes the canonical markdown, and syncs the
top-level `acceptance[]` / `verify[]` into it — never dual-author those lists.

Each entry (the `stories.template.json` shape): `slug`
(`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`), `type: "story"`, `title`, `body` (`goal`, optional
`spec`, `changes[{path, assumption}]` — `creates|refactors-existing|deletes`,
`non_goals`, `reason_to_exist`), top-level `acceptance[]`, `verify[]`
(`… (unit|contract|e2e|validate)`), `depends_on[]` (N>1 only).

Artifacts under `temp/plan-<slug>/`: `stories.json`
(**length 1 by default**; over-budget Specs fail closed — split or tighten,
never under `docs/`); optional `techspec.md` (**N===1 only** — folded into
`## Spec`); optional `acceptance-manifest.json` (N>1 partition list — pass as
`--plan-acceptance`). For N=1, use the envelope `systemPrompts.story` and emit
one cohesive Story. Split only under the policy above.

**Tickets mode:** every Story authors a top-level `supersedes[]` claiming the
source issues it replaces; persist refuses a partial map
([shape](helpers/plan-reference.md)).

### 2.5 Critics

```bash
node .agents/scripts/plan-critics.js \
  --stories temp/plan-<slug>/stories.json \
  [--tech-spec temp/plan-<slug>/techspec.md]
```

Run **before** persist — the last point a finding folds into a re-author
round. It exits 0 on **any** verdict (verdicts route work, they do not
gate) and exits **1** only on a usage/IO error — no critic ran, no skip
ledgered: **do not proceed to Persist**; fix and re-run.

- **Both `dispatch: false`** — proceed to Persist (each skip is ledgered).
- **Either `dispatch: true`** — dispatch **one fresh-context, maker-blind
  sub-agent per firing critic** (hand it only the draft artifacts,
  never the authoring transcript), fold findings into Gate #2 or a
  re-author round, re-run this step. Pre-mortem triggers (incl. the
  external-dependency probe), folding the advisory-only
  `textHygiene.findings[]` lints, and the role-scoped dispatch shape:
  [`helpers/plan-reference.md` § Critic dispatch detail](helpers/plan-reference.md).

### 3. Persist

**Gate #2** — with `--force-review`, STOP for approval before persist (the
**only** trigger). Under `--yes`, auto-proceed.

Run persist with `--dry-run` **first** — same command, GitHub writes
suppressed; every gate (validator, body parse, DAG, capacity, budget,
reachability, split/supersede partitions, Spec fold) runs before the first
`createIssue`. Then:

```bash
node .agents/scripts/plan-persist.js \
  --stories temp/plan-<slug>/stories.json \
  --plan-dir temp/plan-<slug> \
  [--plan-acceptance temp/plan-<slug>/acceptance-manifest.json] \
  [--tech-spec temp/plan-<slug>/techspec.md] \
  [--source-tickets 123,456] [...flags from the table above]
```

At lite shape, `--chain-on-clean` chains that dry-run into the real persist in
one round-trip **only** when it is clean and `lite`; a full-route plan keeps
its review round-trip.

Persist creates `type::story` issue(s) plus a `plan-run::<id>` grouping label
(**metadata only**); N>1 `depends_on` edges become `blocked by #<id>`
footers. `agent::ready` is the **terminal** flip after all receipts land — a
ready Story is fully persisted. stdout is pure JSON.

In `--tickets` mode persist resolves source ids **envelope-first** and closes
each as `not_planned` with a comment (default on;
[detail](helpers/plan-reference.md)). On a stranded persist, re-run the same
command — never hand-delete issues.

## Constraints

- `/plan` never starts delivery. Duplicate search targets open Stories
  (`type::story`), not Epics.
- Deterministic gates still fail closed under `--yes`.
