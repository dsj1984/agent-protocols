  Standard validation, commit, completion, and notification workflow for agent

# Finalize Sprint Task

When instructed to finalize a sprint task, you must execute the following steps
precisely:

1. **Branch Guard**: Before ANY git operations, verify you are NOT on `main` or
   `master`. Run `git branch --show-current`. If the result is `main` or
   `master`, **STOP IMMEDIATELY** and alert the user. All sprint work MUST
   happen on `sprint-[NUM]` or a `sprint-[NUM]/[TASK_ID]` feature branch.
2. **Validation**: Ensure all validation and pre-commit hooks pass
   (`npm run lint`, etc.). Fix any resulting errors.
3. **Branch & Commit**: Create a new isolated branch for your task FROM the
   sprint base:
   `git checkout sprint-[SPRINT_NUMBER] ; git checkout -b sprint-[SPRINT_NUMBER]/[TASK_ID]`.
   Stage your changes and commit using standard conventional commits:
   `[type]([scope]): [lowercase conventional commit message]`.
4. **Push Feature Branch**: Push your code upstream: `git push -u origin HEAD`.
5. **State Sync**: Switch back to `sprint-[NUM]`. Execute `git pull --rebase` to
   fetch any state updates from sibling agents.
6. **Update Playbook (4-State Track)**:
   - Open `.agents/docs/sprints/sprint-[NUM]/playbook.md` (or the equivalent
     Playbook Path).
   - Locate your task and change its status from Executing `- [~]` to Committed
     `- [/]`.
   - In the Mermaid diagram, locate your Chat Session and update the class from
     `executing` to `committed` **inside the mermaid block** (e.g., change
     `class C4 executing` to `class C4 committed`).
7. **Commit State**: Commit ONLY the playbook update:
   `git commit -am "chore(sprint): update task status to committed"`. Push this
   state tracking commit upstream: `git push`. (If it fails due to concurrent
   edits from other agents, run `git pull --rebase` and try pushing again).
8. **Notification**: If the variable `AGENT_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK` is defined in
   the `AGENTS.md` file, make a webhook call to that URL. **You must send a JSON
   payload with a `message` parameter**. Example:
   `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "Sprint step [TASK_ID] was pushed to its feature branch."}' $AGENT_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK`
   If the variable is not set, fail gracefully without error.

## State Progression Reference

| Transition              | Checkbox      | Mermaid Class               | Triggered By                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Not Started → Executing | `[ ]` → `[~]` | `not_started` → `executing` | Agent Execution Protocol (Step 2) |
| Executing → Committed   | `[~]` → `[/]` | `executing` → `committed`   | This workflow (Step 6)            |
| Committed → Complete    | `[/]` → `[x]` | `committed` → `complete`    | `sprint-integration` workflow     |

## Constraint

Do NOT skip any of the steps above. You MUST ensure validation passes, your code
feature branch is pushed, AND the playbook on `sprint-[NUM]` is updated with
`- [/]`. Do NOT merge your feature branch code directly into `sprint-[NUM]` —
the `sprint-integration` workflow handles all code merging.
